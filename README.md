# About
Anti-Malware (formerly M2tool) is a Python-based application designed to detect and remove malicious files from a system. Initially developed as M2tool, the project has evolved into a more advanced anti-malware solution following several enhancements and added features.
The tool scans files and directories for malware using the VT API, with a focus on identifying suspicious  .dll, .exe, etc payloads. It offers real-time monitoring, heuristic analysis, and automated email reporting with comprehensive information to keep administrators informed of detected threats.

# Features
1. SOC NODE: This is a secure gateway that allows the Anti-Malware Administrator to silently connect to a client machine through a secured socket.
2. Realtime Monitoring: Sometimes, your operating system's antivirus may fail to detect certain malicious files. This project enhances detection by leveraging over 35 antivirus engines and sandbox technologies through the VT.
3. Reporting
4. Realtime alert using resend (Externally) and mailHog (Locally) by https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog
